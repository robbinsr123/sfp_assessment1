### API Use
First, you must [login](https://www.themoviedb.org/login) or [create an account](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) with TMDb.
To get TMDb API token, visit the API tab in your [account settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
Once you have landed on the API details page, click to generate an API key at the bottom of the page.
